This mod adds a machine into the game that can print any item from XP. Place an item into an empty printer and **start sneaking** to deposit experience! **Jumping** while sneaking lets you deposit more XP at a time.

When the XP bar is full, the printing process begins! A translucent item will appear above the machine and slowly become more opaque over time. You can take it out once it's completely solid!

### Additional Features

- The Printer can pick up lingering XP orbs on its own
- Hoppers can take printed items from machines
- The printed stack is an exact duplicate of whatever you put in, preserving enchantments, name, etc.
- `enablePrinter` gamerule for whether to allow use of The Printer by default
- Shader-compatible; the image above uses [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) and [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.complementary.dev/reimagined/)

...and more!

### Customization

The cost and printing duration for a stack depend on various factors, including:

- Material or item type
- Item rarity
- NBT contents

They can also be heavily extended and customized with **Printer Rules**, a fully data-driven system to modify values depending on the item.
